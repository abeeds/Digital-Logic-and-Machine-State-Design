# Part 2

Write the Verilog Module for a 4-bit Counter (using a behavioral Verilog description) that:

(1) Counts from 0 to 15 and then loops back to 0 - updating at each positive edge of the Clock signal<br/>
(2) Increments forward or backward with each positive edge of the Clock given a control signal ‘F’<br/> 
(3) The Counter in (2) programmable to increment forward or backward with only odd or even numbers using the control bit ‘P’<br/>
