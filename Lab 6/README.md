# Lab 6
In this Lab, we will attempt to build a 3-bit ripple counter (schematic below) using the DFlip Flop with a reset input and simulate it with a testbench to verify correct operation. <br/>
The assertion of the reset brings the counter outputs to ‘000’ <br/>
Implement a schematic of a 3-bit ripplecounter that loops back to ‘000’


The simulation run in Vivado is provided below. <br/>
